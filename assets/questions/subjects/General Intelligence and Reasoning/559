Which one of the four interchanges in signs and numbers would make the given equation correct?  </br> 3 + 5 - 2 = 4 </br>  चिन्हों और संख्याओं के दिए गए चार बदलाव में कौन सा बदलाव समीकरण को सही बनाएगा?  </br> 3 + 5 - 2 = 4   
@+ and -, 2 and 3@+ and -, 2 and 5@+ and -, 3 and 5@None of these@3@By making the interchanges given in (a), we get the question as 2 - 5 + 3 = 4 or 0 = 4, which is false. </br> By making the interchanges given in (b), we get the equation as 3 - 2 + 5 = 4 or 6 = 4, which is false. </br>By making the interchanges given in (c), we get the equation as 5 - 3 + 2 = 4 or 4 = 4, which is true.
